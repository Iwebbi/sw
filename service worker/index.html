<body>
    <p>
        We have workers in JavaScript and there are three sections of workers.
        Web Worker, Web Socket and Service Worker.
        These are script that run in the background without interfering the UI.
        In another word, we can say that these workers run in a seperate thread than the main
        browser thread which helps to improve the application performance because it does not
        bother excessive activities of the main thread.
    </p>
    <h3>DIFFERENCES</h3>
    <p>
        The web workers and web socket have DOM access whereas service worker has no dom access because
        it runs on a worker context.
        The web socket is actually a part of main thread that helps to access and manipulate the DOM.
    </p>
    <h3>WEB WORKER</h3>
    We know that our HTML perser, parses the html code line by line and as soon as it finds the
    script tag, it blocks the entire UI until we the output of the script. So, in order ot overcome from this blocking
    nature, we use web worker. Web worker actually runs the script tag in a different environment so
    that our complex operations don't bock the UI and generate the script output from different thread and provide the
    output.

    <p>
        Web workers are used to run the code in a background script.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can create a worker object using contstructor worker()
    </p>
    <p>
        Workers run in a different global context
    </p>
    <p>
        We use workers to do complex operations without interfering the UI
    </p>
    <P>
        We can sent and accept messsages or data from UI using events.
    </P>

    var workerObj = new Worker('workerFileName.js'); <br>
    We use onMessage(); To receive the messsages
    postMessage(); to send the data or messages
